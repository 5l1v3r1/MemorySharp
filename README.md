# MemorySharp #

## Synopsis ##

MemorySharp is a C# based memory editing library targeting Windows applications, offering various functions to extract and inject data and codes into remote processes to allow interoperability.

The goal of this library is to provide a safe, powerful and easy to use API, keeping the remote process as clean as possible.
The library can only be used within 32-bit development.

MemorySharp is available under two different models of distribution, as explained in the license:

- **The community edition**: enabling open source and non commercial development (this version available on Github).
- **The commercial edition**: enabling closed source distribution and commercial development. This package also provides **premium support** and the **official documentation** dedicated to learn the art of Memory Editing with the library.

## Examples ##

### Reading/Write data ###

These are basically two ways to read/write data. The first one is to use the the `MemorySharp` class :

```csharp
var address = IntPtr.Zero;
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Read an array of 3 integers
int[] integers = sharp.Read<int>(address, 3);
// Write a string
sharp.WriteString(address, "I love managed languages.");
```

The second way is to use `RemotePointer` objects. These objects are instanciated using the indexer on `MemorySharp` objects :

```csharp
var address = IntPtr.Zero;
var offset = IntPtr.Zero;
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Read an array of 3 integers
int[] integers = sharp[address].Read<int>(offset, 3);
// Write a string
sharp[address].WriteString("I love managed languages.");
```

### Execute/Inject code ###

Executing code is very similar to read and write memory. The `Assembly` factory can be used :

```csharp
var address = IntPtr.Zero;
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Execute code and get the return value as boolean
var ret = sharp.Assembly.Execute<bool>(address);
```

Using RemotePointer is also possible :

```csharp
var address = IntPtr.Zero;
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Execute code and get the return value as a Vector3 structure
var vector = sharp[address].Execute<Vector3>(address, "a parameter", "another one");
```

The parameters like `string` are dynamically allocated in the remote process memory and freed as soon as the execution of the code terminated.

Here, some FASM mnemonics are injected at a given address :

```csharp
var address = IntPtr.Zero;
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Inject mnemonics
sharp.Assembly.Inject(
    new[]
        {
            "push 0",
            "add esp, 4",
            "retn"
        },
    address);
```

Lazy people will enjoy the assembly transactions to remote inject and execute code :

```csharp
var address = IntPtr.Zero;
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Inject and execute code lazily
using(var t = sharp.Assembly.BeginTransaction())
{
	t.AddLine("mov eax, {0}", address);
	t.AddLine("call eax");
	t.AddLine("retn");
}
```

The code is then automatically executed in the remote process.

### Thread-and-play ###

Here are some examples to show how it's easy to play with remote threads.

Hijacking a thread :

```csharp
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

sharp.Threads.MainThread.Context.Eip = address;
```

What ? Yes of course... the code suspends and resumes the thread when changing its context.

Freeze the application :

```csharp
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

sharp.Threads.SuspendAll();
```

Extract specific information from the TEB :

```csharp
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

var tlsPtr = sharp.Threads.MainThread.Teb.Tls;
```

TLS cloning (only for the demo, it would be quite evil to really do that) :

```csharp
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

sharp.Threads.RemoteThreads.First().Teb.TlsSlots = sharp.Threads.RemoteThreads.Last().Teb.TlsSlots;
```

### Inject/eject Modules ###

Here a module is injected and ejected using the `IDisposable` interface :

```csharp
string path = [..];
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

using (var module = sharp.Modules.Inject(path))
{
    module.FindFunction("MessageBoxW").Execute(0, "Hey", "Title", 0);
}
```

One more time, using indexer here is interesting :

```csharp
var address = IntPtr.Zero;
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// It's in[dexer]ception !
sharp["kernel32"]["MessageBoxW"].Execute(0, "Hey", "Title", 0);
```

The traditional way is also available :

```csharp
var address = IntPtr.Zero;
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

var module = sharp.Modules.Inject(path);
module.Eject();
```

### Query/interact with windows ###

Resize and move a window :

```csharp
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Move and resize
sharp.MainWindow.X = 200;
sharp.MainWindow.Y = 200;
sharp.MainWindow.Height = 200;
sharp.MainWindow.Width = 200;
```

Write a text in Notepad++ :

```csharp
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Find Scintilla
var scintilla = sharp.Windows.GetWindowsByClassName("Scintilla").FirstOrDefault();
// If scintilla was found
if(scintilla != null)
{
	// Write something
	scintilla.Keyboard.Write("Hello, World!");
}
```

Click on the top left corner of a window :

```csharp
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Get the window
var window = sharp.Windows.MainWindow;
// Activate it to be in foreground
window.Activate();
// Move the cursor
window.Mouse.MoveTo(0, 0);
// Perform a left click
window.Mouse.ClickLeft();
```

How about pressing a key ?

```csharp
var sharp = new MemorySharp(Process.GetCurrentProcess());

// Get the window
var window = sharp.Windows.MainWindow;
// Press the bottom arrow down and repeat the message every 20ms
window.Keyboard.Press(Keys.Down, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(20));
// Wait 3 seconds
Thread.Sleep(3000);
// Release the key
window.Keyboard.Release(Keys.Down);
```

## Go ahead! ##

This library offers a huge and fully documented API. I highly suggest you to use an IDE that has Intellisense or an equivalent to see the list of the properties/methods available.

The best way to learn how to use it is by participating to the community present on the [official forum](http://www.binarysharp.com/forums "official forum") of MemorySharp and of course... make thousand tests on random apps and crashing them !

I would be very happy to listen your feedback on my [official website](http://www.binarysharp.com "offcial website"), where you also can find premium support and features.

The last but not the least point, I suggest you to read the below paragraph about licensing to fully understand how you can legally use MemorySharp.


## License model ##

MemorySharp is made available under a dual-license model. MemorySharp is freely available for non-commercial use under the terms of the GNU General Public License. A proprietary version of MemorySharp developed in parallel for professional commercial use by [Binarysharp](http://www.binarysharp.com "Binarysharp") is made available under different license terms, to suit end-user need.

I believe this model offers the best of both worlds. People developing their software under an open source model are freely availed of the MemorySharp source code and the MemorySharp open source project benefits in return from enhancements, bug reports and external development ideas. Those people developing under a proprietary source model, from whom the MemorySharp code base does not benefit through reciprocal openness, contribute financially instead. License fees fund research and development of today's and tomorrow's versions of the MemorySharp through research activities at partner institutions.


### The GPL-licensed library ###

MemorySharp is available under the GPL. Please read the full text of the GPL (available in the LICENSE file) prior to downloading and/or using the MemorySharp source code. Your downloading and/or use of the code signifies acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license. If you are unable to comply with the license terms, please immediately destroy all copies of the code in your possession.

Please be aware that while the GPL allows you to freely use the source code, it also imposes certain restrictions on the way in which you can use the code. Your attention is drawn particularly to section 2b of the GPL: "You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.", i.e. your software incorporating or linking to MemorySharp must also be open-source software, licensed under the GPL. Use of the MemorySharp in breach of the terms of the GPL will be subject to legal action by the copyright holders.

### Licenses for professional and commercial use ###

The holders of the copyright of MemorySharp have elected to make this code available under proprietary licenses for professional and commercial use by people for whom the GPL license is not ideal. These license arrangements are managed by [Binarysharp](http://www.binarysharp.com "Binarysharp"). Please visit the Binarysharp's [website](http://www.binarysharp.com "website") for information on products, license terms and pricing.

Binarysharp also provide a variety of value-added services, including premium support and premium features.

## Credits ##

At the beginning, I thank my Notepad++ app, because it suffered so many crashes due to bad injections and wrong codes of my part.

More seriously, I thank the entire [Ownedcore](http://www.ownedcore.com "Ownedcore") community, which allows me to learn the art of the Memory Editing. Especially **Apoc**, who is a very inspirational person for me with his  posts giving so well-written pieces of code without asking anything in return (this includes examples / offsets / guides /libraries), **Cypher** for his *very* critical mind about coding practices, **Bananenbrot** for giving nice advices in a lot of threads of the board, **TOM_RUS** for his very high-skilled eyes to read asm, making very comprehensive wrappers and **Shynd**, who gave me the idea of creating my own library. I certainly forget tons of people here.

This is because there are so many people ready to share their skills that I decided to publish a GPL-licensed version of MemorySharp.
